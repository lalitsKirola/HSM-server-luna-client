Issues i faced during configuration:

When i was checking ./lunacm by getting inside pod... getting current slot id as none...

# ./lunacm

lunacm (64-bit) v10.7.1-125. Copyright (c) 2024 Thales Group. All rights reserved.

Available HSMS:

0

0

Current Slot Id: None

lunacm:>

#exit

command terminated with exit code 12


Solution:

Make sure the configuration file for Luna is correctly set up. The file should be located at /usr/local/luna/config/Chrystoki.conf (or another specified configuration path). You may need to check if:

The correct slot is defined in the configuration.

The HSMâ€™s IP or hostname is properly configured.

The ChrystokiConfigurationPath environment variable is set correctly.


You can manually inspect the config file by running:

cat /usr/local/luna/config/Chrystoki.conf
